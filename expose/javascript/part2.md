1. 3 would be printed because the loop ends when i=3.
2. 150 would be printed because 300 is the last element of the prices array and 150 is its value after applying the discount.
3. 150 would be printed because 300 is the last element of the prices array and 150 is its value after applying the discount and rounding.
4. This function would return an array of the values in the prices array after applying a discount of 0.5. After the discount is applied to a value in the prices array, the value would be rounded then pushed into the discounted array, which is returned by the function.
5. The code causes an error because the variable i is out of scope. The variable was declared with let in the for loop.
6. The code causes an error because the variable discountedPrice is also out of scope. The variable is only accessible within the for loop.
7. 150 would be printed because 300 is the last element of the prices array and 150 is its value after applying the discount and rounding. The variable finalPrice was declared at the start of the function so it is not out of scope.
8. This function would return an array of the values in the prices array after applying a discount of 0.5. After the discount is applied to a value in the prices array, the value would be rounded then pushed into the discounted array, which is returned by the function. The variable discounted was also declared at the started of the function so it is not out of scope.
9. The code causes an error because the variable i is out of scope. The variable was declared with let in the for loop.
10. 3 would be printed because the length of the prices array is 3.
11. This function would return an array of the values in the prices array after applying a discount of 0.5. After the discount is applied to a value in the prices array, the value would be rounded then pushed into the discounted array, which is returned by the function.
12. A. student.name  
    B. student['Grad Year']  
    C. student.greeting()  
    D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name  
    E. student.courseLoad[0]  
13. A. '32';  2 is converted to a string then concatenated to '3'  
    B. 1;  3 is converted to a number then we subtract 2 from 3  
    C. 3;  null is converted to 0 then added to 3  
    D. '3null';  null is converted to a string then concatenated to '3'  
    E. 4;  true is converted to 1 then added to 3  
    F. 0;  false is converted to 0 then added to null which is converted to 0
    G. '3undefined';  undefined is converted to a string then concatenated to '3'  
    H. NaN;  '3' is converted to a number then we subtract undefined from 3, but undefined is NaN when converted to a number so the result becomes NaN.  
14. A. true;  '2' is converted to a number then compared with 1  
    B. false;  '2' and '12' are compared as strings based on the characters' ASCII values  
    C. true;  '2' is converted to a number then compared with 2  
    D. false;  the operands' data types were compared and they were not equal  
    E. false;  true is converted to 1 then compared with 2  
    F. true;  true is compared with the Boolean value of 2, which is also true  
15. The == operator compares the operands after type conversion if needed, while the === operator compares both the data type and value of the operands.

17. The array [ 2, 4, 6 ] would be returned because each value in the input array becomes the input to the callback function and the output of the callback function is then pushed into the output array. I arrived at this result by analyzing how the inputs are handled in the function, then test running the function with the example arguments.
18. In part2-question18.js
19. The output of the code should be 1, 4, 3, 2 where each number is on a separate line in the respective order.
